# Take-home Challenge

### Overview:

Your task is to create a PHP API that will expose RESTful JSON endpoints that a mobile application can integrate with. You can use any frameworks or libraries that would assist in completing the project.

You have been supplied with a CSV file of user data and their vehicles. You will have to write a method to import the data into your application and implement an endpoint to consume the data.

### Requirements:

1. A function to import a list of vehicles from the pre-defined CSV format either via a CLI command or REST endpoint
2. An endpoint, returning JSON, to retrieve the list of vehicles
    - The ability to filter all available vehicles by owner
    - The ability to filter sort available vehicles by year of purchase
    - The ability to filter search available vehicles by registration plate
3. Testing across both features

We will be assessing your submission on the following criteria:

- Project approach and architecture
- Modelling/Database Structure
- Error handling
- Code quality
- Robustness of the CSV importer
- Testing

**Note: We are not expecting any UI to be built as part of this take-home**

### Submission:

Please complete the task using a Git source control tool such as GitHub or Bitbucket. Remember to commit your code regularly. On completion please provide access and the URL to the repository. You should include documentation that covers how to run your application and the CSV importer.
